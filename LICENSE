Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and 
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take 
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General 
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all 
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you 
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the 
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can 
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights 
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain 
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: 
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
